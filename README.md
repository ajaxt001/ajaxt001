A majority of my application development has been on the IBM classic midrange platform (IBM/38, AS400 and IBM i) utilizing all flavors and versions of RPG available to me.  Around 2007 I branched out into the field of data-warehousing and was the main developer and administrator on our companies Informatica Power platform (we used the ETL concept where all data was extracted to a staging area on the ETL server).  

For the past number of years i have been updating the skill utilizing training and education platforms provided by: Oracle University, Microsoft Learn (Ignite) platform, Pragmatic Works (Learning with the Nerds) and Linked-In learning to update existing skills and to learn new skills.
    Examaples but not all inclusive.
      - Low code (no-code) development with APEX
      - SQL Server development and administration
      - Data Cleansing, Data modeling and Data Visualization (M language and DAX) POWER BI
      
On the IBM i platform I have an account on PUB400 and work on improving my development skills watching and working through vidoes hosted by [Liam Sofor](https://github.com/worksofliam) a leading proponent of open source system (OSS) on IBM I, [#yusy4code ](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/yusy4code) a leading developer of NODE J (OSS) applications on IBM i.
